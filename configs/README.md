Prepare readme that illustrates what you have to do to run experiment.

# Typical tasks

 * example config file for first run

 * change primitive type
 * change cipher name
 * key size
 * (iv size)
 * data size
 * choose config file with given generation strategy
 * use multiple seeds if you need to run more experiments
 * write experiment's description for backup-ing your configs

# Later

 * prepare script that generates updates configs for tested cryptoprimitive
