### Documentation: https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SanitizerSpecialCaseList.html#format
src:*
## Lines starting with # are ignored.
## Turn off checks for the source file (use absolute path or path relative
## to the current working directory):
#src:/path/to/source/file.c
## Turn off checks for a particular functions (use mangled names):
#fun:MyFooBar
#fun:_Z8MyFooBarv
## Extended regular expressions are supported:
#fun:bad_(foo|bar)
#src:bad_source[1-9].c
## Shell like usage of * is supported (* is treated as .*):
#src:bad/sources/*
#fun:*BadFunction*
## Specific sanitizer tools may introduce categories.
#src:/special/path/*=special_sources
## Sections can be used to limit blacklist entries to specific sanitizers
#[address]
#fun:*BadASanFunc*
## Section names are regular expressions
#[cfi-vcall|cfi-icall]
#fun:*BadCfiCall
## Entries without sections are placed into [*] and apply to all sanitizers

### Our part:
# Addres sanitizer
[address]
# disable everything to see, if it works
src:*
# DSHA
src:streams/hash/sha3/hash_functions/DynamicSHA/*


# Memory sanitizer
[memory]
src:eacirc-core/external/*

# Undefined behavior sanitizer
# Check groups (like undefined) canâ€™t be used in suppressions file, only fine-grained checks are supported.
